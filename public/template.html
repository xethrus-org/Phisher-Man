                Fake Password Reset
            </h3>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;A fake password reset email is a relatively common type of phishing email.
                These fake emails work by convincing the user that they accidently triggered
                a password reset on one of their accounts and must reset their password.
                Often times, more precise phishing attacks will ensure that the targeted
                user actually owns an account of the type specified in the email. This increases
                the likelihood the attacker has of the user actually falling for the scam and
                entering an old password in addition to a new password, granting the attacker the
                actual password of that account.

                Fake Invoice
            </h3>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;A fake invoice is one of the most common phishing email types. These work about how
                one might expect. An attacker will send a user a fake invoice to pay for some item or
                service that does not actually exist. The user, if they respond, will either end up
                paying for these items/services, revealing sensitive information such as their payment
                information, or, in many cases, both. Fake invoices may be one of (if not the most)
                effective phishing scam formats out there.

                Fake Compromised Account
            </h3>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;A compromised account email is another common type of phishing email, as it is extremely
                effective. These work by informing the user that one of their accounts has been compromised
                and they are thus required to verify important account information immediately to protect
                their account. This is particularly effective because it creates a sense of urgency in the
                user, making them more likely to fall for this particular phishing scam. Naturally, once
                they "verify" their account details, said details are sent to the attacker who can now
                access the victim's account based on the given information.
