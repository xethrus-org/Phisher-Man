                <h3>Fake Password Reset</h3>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;A fake password reset email is a relatively common type of phishing email. These fake emails
                    work by convincing the user that they accidently triggered a password reset on one of their
                    accounts and must reset their password. Often times, more precise phishing attacks will ensure
                    that the targeted user actually owns an account of the type specified in the email. This increases
                    the likelihood the attacker has of the user actually falling for the scam and entering an old password
                    in addition to a new password, granting the attacker the actual password of that account.

                <h3>Fake Invoice</h3>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;A fake invoice is one of the most common phishing email types. These work about how
                    one might expect. An attacker will send a user a fake invoice to pay for some item or service that
                    does not actually exist. The user, if they respond, will either end up paying for these items/services,
                    revealing sensitive information such as their payment information, or, in many cases, both. Fake invoices
                    may be one of (if not the most) effective phishing scam formats out there.

                <h3>Fake Compromised Account Notification</h3>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;A compromised account email is another common type of phishing email, as it is extremely
                    effective. These work by informing the user that one of their accounts has been compromised and they
                    are thus required to verify important account information immediately to protect their account. This
                    is particularly effective because it creates a sense of urgency in the user, making them more likely
                    to fall for this particular phishing scam. Naturally, once they "verify" their account details, said
                    details are sent to the attacker and sending of the phishing email.
