                <h3>What is Phishing?</h3>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Phishing is a form of social engineering that is most often used to steal or trick a user
                    into revealing sensitive data. Sensitive data may include information such as passwords,
                    bank details, or identifying information such as Social Security Numbers. In a corporate
                    setting, this could mean revealing information important to a company, such as the emails,
                    passwords, or other sensitive information of a company's owners, employees, or even users.
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;One of the most common phishing attack methods is through email, where attackers 
                    will send users fake emails to trick them into opening their fake email and clicking on a link. Once
                    the link has been clicked, the attacker can take several new avenues of attack, such as
                    attempting to download malware on the victim's device or continuing the phishing attack by
                    prompting the victim for sensitive information.

                <h3>What is a Phishing Simulator?</h3>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;A phishing simulator is a piece of software that simulates a real phishing attack in order
                    to determine how vulnerable a group of people or, most commonly, a company's employees to
                    certain types of phishing attacks. This software will send out fake phishing emails that do
                    not contain any malicious links, but are designed to mimic the look and feel of real, malicious
                    phishing emails in order to properly bait the receivers of the simulation and make them believe
                    that the email is genuine. <br>&emsp;&emsp;If a user falls for the fake phishing attack, whether it be
                    by clicking on a certain link, entering sensitive details into the simulation, or attempting to download
                    random software, this failure is documented by the phishing simulator software and sent to the user
                    of the software which, in this case, would be the employer or manager of the simulation's receivers.
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;The user or sender of the emails generally is able to then view a report or a list
                    of statistics that document the success rate of the receivers, which allows the sender to determine
                    how important phishing awareness and implementation of countermeasures to phishing and social
                    engineering is to their group or company.
